## Materials for ML workshop at Duke University
## Adam Chekroud, Yale University

----------------------------------------


- This repository contains the materials that will be used during a two-day machine learning workshop at Duke.

- You will find folders inside containing:
  - an example data set
  - talk slides
  - PDFs for relevant textbooks
  - other resources.

There are also some scripts:
1. basic_R.R
  - Contains some very introductory R code.
  - If you have used R before then you won't need to read it
  - If you are new to R then it may help give you an idea of syntax
2. dukePackageInstaller.R
  - Should install the main R packages we will be using.
  - You should be able to source the script directly, and it will indicate whether it was likely to work
    - to do this type `source dukePackageInstaller.R` into your terminal. 
    - if it worked, it should return > [1] "This probably worked as expected"`
  - Either way, if you read the code it should be fairly easy to see which packages you need to install manually
3. skeleton.R
  - Contains the main demonstration script that we will be working through.
