# Applied Machine Learning for Psychiatry/Neuroscience
### Two-day machine learning workshop at Duke University Medical School & Durham VA
### Adam Chekroud, [Yale University](http://mccarthylab.yale.edu)

----------------------------------------


- This repository contains the materials that will be used during a two-day machine learning workshop at Duke. This workshop will serve as a theoretical and practical introduction to using machine learning methods to solve clinically important problems. It takes a high-level approach, with almost no equations, and uses examples drawn from various areas of biology.

- The materials are all available for free (yay, science!), but please do cite our paper and let me know if you find any of this useful!

- You will find folders inside containing:
  - an example data set
  - talk slides
  - PDFs for relevant textbooks
  - other resources.

There are also some scripts

1. **basic_R.R**
  - Contains some very introductory R code.
  - If you have used R before then you won't need to read it
  - If you are new to R then it may help give you an idea of syntax
2. **dukePackageInstaller.R**
  - Should install the main R packages we will be using.
  - You should be able to source the script directly, and it will indicate whether it was likely to work
    - to do this type `source dukePackageInstaller.R` into your terminal. 
    - if it worked, it should return "This probably worked as expected"
  - Either way, if you read the code it should be fairly easy to see which packages you need to install manually
3. **skeleton.R**
  - Contains the main demonstration script that we will be working through.
  
  
As a reminder:

- You can install the latest version of R for free [here](http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/)
- And install the latest version of Rstudio for free [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)
